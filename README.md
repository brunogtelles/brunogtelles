Hey! I'm Bruno Telles ðŸŽ¸ðŸš€

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a music lover, naturally creative, and always exploring new ways to communicate and build things. Here you'll find some of my work and adventures in the dev world.

About Me
I'm Bruno Gabriel Telles, and my dev journey started years ago with C# and JavaScript. Since then, I've evolved to work with Laravel and React â€“ two tools I'm constantly sharpening to keep them as staples in my tech arsenal.

What I Do

ðŸŽµ Music & Creativity: When I'm not coding, I'm playing music (been at it since childhood). Figuring out songs by ear is my go-to stress reliever during bug-fixing weeks.


ðŸ’» Web Dev: Currently diving deep into Laravel and React. I craft elegant, efficient solutions and chase challenges worthy of the "Laravel artisan" title wink.

My Toolkit

ðŸ”¹ Laravel: PHP framework for building powerful, elegant apps.

ðŸ”¹ React: JavaScript library for modern, interactive UIs.

ðŸ”¹ C#: Beastly language I used for 2+ years.

ðŸ”¹ JavaScript: The foundation of my web adventures.
